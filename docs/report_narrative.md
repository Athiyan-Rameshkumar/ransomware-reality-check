# Ransomware Reality Check Report Narrative

## Executive Summary
This assessment estimates how ransomware could impact your organization based on current identity, endpoint, and visibility controls.

It does not indicate that an attack is happening.
It shows how prepared you are if one were to occur.

---

## How Ransomware Would Likely Get In
Most ransomware incidents begin with stolen credentials.

### What We Looked At
- Whether accounts require strong multi-factor authentication
- Risky or unusual sign-in behavior
- Use of older sign-in methods

### What We Found
(Automatically generated findings summarized here)

---

## How Far Ransomware Could Spread
Once ransomware runs on one system, it often spreads using legitimate access.

### What We Looked At
- Administrative access across systems
- Ability to isolate compromised devices
- Credential reuse patterns

### What We Found
(Generated findings summarized here)

## How Exposed the Organization Is
This score reflects ransomware blast radius, not attack likelihood.

### Identity Protection

## Fix This First (Top 5)
These actions reduce ransomware risk the fastest and require minimal cost.

1. Enable strong MFA on all admin accounts
2. Disable legacy authentication methods
3. Ensure all devices have active endpoint protection
4. Reduce administrative access where possible
5. Confirm logging is enabled and retained

---

## What Good Looks Like
Organizations with strong ransomware resistance typically:
- Require MFA everywhere
- Limit administrative privileges
- Can isolate compromised systems quickly
- Retain sufficient logs to investigate incidents

---

## Important Notes
This tool does not:
- Detect ransomware
- Monitor your systems
- Replace security software

It is designed to support better security decisions.
