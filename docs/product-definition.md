# Ransomware Reality Check

## What This Is
A free, privacy-safe ransomware readiness assessment for small organizations,
built and hosted by ChiEAC.

## Who It Is For
- Nonprofits
- Clinics
- Small professional firms
- Community organizations
- SMBs without security staff

## The 10-Minute Experience
1. User uploads existing security exports OR answers guided questions
2. Tool analyzes ransomware exposure
3. User receives a plain-English report
4. Report tells them:
   - How ransomware would likely get in
   - How far it could spread
   - What to fix first

## What This Is Not
- Not a scanner
- Not a monitoring tool
- Not a detection system
- Not a compliance audit

## Why It Exists
Most security tools tell small organizations *after* damage occurs.
This tool helps them reduce damage *before* anything happens.

## Trust & Safety
- No credentials
- No live access
- Upload → process → delete
- No data retained

## Ownership
This tool is a ChiEAC community resource.
